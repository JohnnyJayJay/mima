# mima

An emulator of the "minimal machine" ("mima") used as a processor model for learning purposes.

This project implements an assembler and disassembler for its instructions as well as a virtual runtime to execute and debug mima binaries.

This is a WIP, more features and documentation are to follow soon.

## Installation

1. [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

2. `cargo build --release`

3. The result executable can then be found at `./target/release/mima(.exe)`

I might provide some prebuilt binaries in the future.
